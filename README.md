Payback
===============
In our daily lives and in groups of friends or coworkers,  it is easy to lose track of all the money that gets borrowed between people. For snack machines, coffee and even lunch, people often need to borrow some money. However, after a couple of “loans”, its difficult to remember to who we owe money or who is in our debt.

Payback is a financial tool/application that allows the user to manage and collect their debts in an easy and intuitive fashion. With it, users can keep records of all personal debts and loans and easily transfer their debts to someone who owes the user money, keeping things well organized. It also facilitates splitting costs for expenses shared by groups of people, such as group meals or other activities, by allowing groups of users to take on a shared debt.
