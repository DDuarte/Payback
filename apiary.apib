# Payback API
Payback API is a service to track and optimize debts between a group of friends.

## Authentication
Currently the Payback API does not provide authenticated access.
Authentication will be implemented using OAuth, with logins by username and password, Facebook, Google and other services.

## Digital Signature
To prevent tampering of the data, a digital signature is included as a query parameter in the resources' URI.

## Media Types
Where applicable this API uses the JSON media-type to represent resources states and affordances.

Requests with a message-body are using plain JSON to set or update resource states.

## Error States
The common [HTTP Response Status Codes](https://github.com/for-GET/know-your-http-well/blob/master/status-codes.md) are used.
